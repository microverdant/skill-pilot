### 🎯 Everyone — Master AI and Prepare for the AI Era

The most valuable skill in the next decade is knowing how to work with AI effectively. Skill Pilot is designed to grow with you:

- **Agent skills** you build become reusable assets — your AI gets smarter over time
- **Community knowledge sharing** — learn from and contribute to a growing library of capabilities
- **Multi-agent workflows** — chain AI agents together to solve complex, multi-step problems
- **Your personal AI habitat** — a workspace that evolves as you do

---

## What Is Skill Pilot?

Skill Pilot is an **AI-native workspace** you run locally. It connects your favorite AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more) to a structured environment of reusable skills, tools, and workflows.

Instead of using AI as a chat assistant, Skill Pilot turns AI into an active worker that:

- Reads and modifies your codebase
- Executes tasks on your computer
- Learns new capabilities through reusable "skills"
- Operates across your entire digital workflow — not just code

**In short:** You describe what you want. The AI does it. The system gets better every time.

---

## What Is Codeware?

Traditional software is static — it ships with fixed features that only change when developers update it.

**Codeware is different.** The source code itself is the product, and AI continuously extends it based on what you need.

```
Traditional:  Human → UI → Software → Fixed behavior
Codeware:     Human → AI → Codebase → Evolving behavior
```

In Skill Pilot:

| Traditional Software | Skill Pilot Codeware |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| You use features | You grow capabilities |
| Updates come from developers | Updates come from AI + you |
| Fixed at release | Evolves through use |
| One-size-fits-all | Adapts to your needs |

The system is not "used". It is **grown**.

---

## Usage

After [installation](#installation), run:

```bash
# cd <your installation path>
./skillpilot.sh help
```

```
Usage: ./skillpilot.sh [help|build|start|stop|test|doctor] [--dev]
       ./skillpilot.sh <enable|disable> <human-detection|live-tts>
       ./skillpilot.sh doctor [question]

Commands:
  help    Show this help message.
  build   Build static webui export (core/webui/www).
  start   Start services. Default command.
  stop    Stop running tmux sessions. Use `--dev` to stop only development sessions.
  test    Run engine pytest suite, or only the named files under core/engine/tests.
  doctor  Open the configured doctor AI agent for troubleshooting and guided help.
  enable human-detection    Install optional human detection dependencies.
  disable human-detection   Uninstall optional human detection dependencies.
  enable live-tts           Install optional live-tts dependencies.
  disable live-tts          Uninstall optional live-tts dependencies.

Options:
  --dev   Use development mode for `start`, or stop only development sessions for `stop`.

Defaults:
  - Command defaults to: start
  - Mode defaults to production (without --dev)
```

### Prod and Dev Modes

Skill Pilot now supports running production and development side by side:

- Production engine and bundled release WebUI: `http://127.0.0.1:3001`
- Development engine: `http://127.0.0.1:3002`
- Development WebUI: `http://127.0.0.1:3003`

Typical workflow:

```bash
./skillpilot.sh
./skillpilot.sh --dev
```

Stop commands:

```bash
./skillpilot.sh stop
./skillpilot.sh stop --dev
```

- `./skillpilot.sh stop` stops production only
- `./skillpilot.sh stop --dev` stops development only

### Using AI Agent CLIs Directly

If you use agent CLIs directly, without the Skill Pilot WebUI:

- For normal usage, start the engine in production mode with `./skillpilot.sh`
- For development workflows, export `SKILL_PILOT_RUNTIME_MODE=development` before starting the agent CLI directly

Examples:

```bash
export SKILL_PILOT_RUNTIME_MODE=development
claude
```

```bash
export SKILL_PILOT_RUNTIME_MODE=development
codex
```

```bash
export SKILL_PILOT_RUNTIME_MODE=development
gemini
```

This ensures the agent CLI can see the same runtime mode as the development engine.

### Troubleshooting with `./skillpilot.sh doctor`

If you get stuck during setup or normal usage, you can open the built-in doctor agent:

```bash
./skillpilot.sh doctor
```

You can also pass the problem directly on the command line:

```bash
./skillpilot.sh doctor "install.sh failed while installing dependencies"
./skillpilot.sh doctor "skillpilot.sh start does not open the WebUI"
```

What it is useful for:

- Troubleshooting `install.sh` or `skillpilot.sh`
- Explaining technical terms or error messages in plain language
- Finding likely environment or dependency problems on your machine
- Investigating bugs in the Skill Pilot codebase

Behavior:

- If no question is provided, Skill Pilot will prompt you and show example questions
- It will try to use the configured doctor provider from `config/ai_providers.json5`
- If the doctor provider is `opencode` and it is not installed yet, Skill Pilot will try to install it automatically
- Once the doctor session starts, you can chat with it like a normal AI assistant
- Exit the doctor session with `/exit` or double `Ctrl-C`

The doctor agent is designed for beginners and can inspect project docs, skills, and source code to help diagnose issues. If a real code fix is needed, it should ask for your approval before making code changes.

For beginner-friendly examples of how to write a good doctor request, see [Skill Pilot Doctor Message Guide](DOCTOR-MESSAGE-GUIDE.md).

## How Skill Pilot Works

1. You run Skill Pilot locally on your machine
2. The AI reads your repository and understands your project
3. You describe what you want — in plain English
4. The AI edits code, runs tasks, or creates new skills to solve it
5. New capabilities are saved as reusable skills for next time
6. Useful skills can be shared back to the community via `contrib`
7. Stable, proven skills are released into `codeware` for everyone

**The system improves every time it is used.**

---

## Branch Model

Skill Pilot separates three layers of evolution so your personal work never conflicts with shared releases.

| Branch | Purpose | Who writes |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `codeware` | Stable release layer | Maintainers |
| `contrib` | Shared improvements between users | Community + AI review |
| `user` | Your personal evolving workspace | You + your AI |

### Flow of knowledge

```
codeware  → user        (receive updates)
user      → contrib     (share what works)
contrib   → codeware    (stabilized release)
```

Rules:

- `codeware` is protected — release only
- `contrib` accepts pull requests from the community
- `user` is freely modified by you and your AI
- AI never edits `codeware` directly

---

## Contributing

You do not contribute by writing features for users. You contribute by **teaching the system a reusable skill**.

Steps:

1. Work in your `user` branch
2. If multiple users share one computer, each user should fork to a different repo and clone locally to a different path
3. When something is useful → create a PR to `contrib`
4. Maintainers and AI review integration safety
5. Merged into shared knowledge
6. Released into `codeware`

---

## Philosophy

> Software should not contain all knowledge. It should learn knowledge.

Traditional software distributes features.
Codeware distributes capability evolution.

You are not installing an application.

You are installing **a habitat for an AI worker**.

The AI does not operate inside the program.
The program operates inside the AI.

---

## Release Concept

Releases are not feature milestones. They are **intelligence stabilization points**.

A release means:

> The system has learned enough to be trusted.

---

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

If you distribute this software, you must keep the copyright and license
information in `LICENSE` unchanged.

Some parts of this project may include open-source code from other sources.
When a source file or folder includes its own `LICENSE`, that license applies
to that code.

---

## Short Definition

Skill Pilot is an AI-native Codeware system where the source code is the interface, commits are capabilities, and software evolves through use.
