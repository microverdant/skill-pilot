# Feature Retrieval Index: Dev Swarm Software Lifecycle

## Retrieval Keywords

dev swarm, dev-swarm, software lifecycle, AI agile, feature-driven development, sprints, PRD, UX, tech specs, MVP, deployment, market research, personas, tech research, stage, dev swarm skills, dev-swarm-stage, vibe kanban, dev swarm code development, dev swarm code review, dev swarm code test, dev swarm agent

## Scope

- Full software lifecycle management via AI agent swarm
- Stage-based skills: init ideas, market research, personas, UX, PRD, tech research, tech specs, MVP, sprints, deployment, archive
- Dev swarm workflow coordination
- Excludes: vibe coding (simpler project flow), task manager (separate)

## Main Behavior

- Dev swarm coordinates multiple stage skills to take a product from idea to deployment
- Each stage is a skill in `dev-swarm/skills/`
- `dev-swarm-code-development` handles implementation sprints
- `dev-swarm-code-review` handles code review
- `dev-swarm-code-test` handles test writing
- `dev-swarm-stage-*` skills cover each lifecycle stage
- Vibe Kanban extension provides Kanban board for sprint tracking
- Multi-agent research workflow coordinates parallel research tasks
