# tunnel_stop

Stop an active SSH tunnel by tunnel ID.

        Use this tool when you need to close a previously established port-forward tunnel.
        Best for cleanup after a task is done or when the forwarded service is no longer needed.

        Args:
            tunnelId: The tunnel ID returned in the result of forward_remote_to_local or forward_local_to_remote.
                      Retrieve it by calling get_operation_status(operationId) and reading result.tunnelId.
                      Example: "tunnel-abc123"

        Returns:
            JSON object with:
            - success: true if the tunnel was stopped
            - message: confirmation message from the SSH pool

        Do not use this tool:
            - to list active tunnels; use tunnel_list instead
