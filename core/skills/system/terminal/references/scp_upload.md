# scp_upload

Start an asynchronous SFTP upload from localPath to remotePath on an SSH target.

        Use this tool when you need to transfer a local file to a remote SSH host.
        Best for uploading configuration files, binaries, or other artifacts to remote servers.

        Args:
            target: SSH profile identifying the remote host. Must be "ssh:<profile>" (e.g. "ssh:prod", "ssh:dev").
                    Profiles are defined in the server's SSH config file (config.json).
            localPath: Absolute path to the local file to upload. The file must exist before calling.
                       Example: "/home/user/deploy.tar.gz"
            remotePath: Destination path on the remote host.
                        Example: "/opt/app/deploy.tar.gz"

        Returns:
            JSON object with:
            - accepted: true when the operation has been queued
            - operationId: ID to track progress via get_operation_status
            - status: initial operation status (e.g. "pending")
            - target: the SSH target used

        Do not use this tool:
            - to download files from a remote host; use scp_download instead
            - for local-to-local file operations; use exec_command with cp instead
            - with target="local"; this tool only supports SSH targets

        Notes:
            - The upload runs asynchronously. Poll get_operation_status with the operationId for completion.
            - The local file must exist before calling this tool.

## Usage
```bash
core/bin/tool-cli request '{"server_id": "terminal", "tool_name": "scp_upload", "arguments": {}}'
```
**Do not use any Python helper code to invoke the `core/bin/tool-cli` command. Run as shell command with arguments directly.**
