# text_segments_to_speech

Generate speech audio for multiple lines with per-line emotion control.

Args:
    segments: List of dicts with fields text, emotion, and emotion_sample (all required);
              Optionally include ref_emotion_voice per segment as a local audio file path or remote URL;
              when omitted/empty, defaults to ref_voice.
    ref_voice: Local audio file path or remote URL to use as reference for voice characteristics and timbre

Returns:
    List of generated speech audio segments as HTTP URLs (http://host:port/file/path) in WAV format

    Example:
    segments = [
        {
            "text": "Hi there! It is great to meet you.",
            "emotion": "happy",
            "emotion_sample": "I am so glad we finally get to meet in person!",
            "ref_emotion_voice": "/path/to/emotion_voice.wav"
        },
        {
            "text": "This is serious, so please pay attention.",
            "emotion": "serious",
            "emotion_sample": "This is serious, so please pay attention.",
            "ref_emotion_voice": "/path/to/emotion_voice.wav"
        }
    ]
    audio = await text_segments_to_speech(segments, ref_voice="/path/to/reference_voice.wav")
