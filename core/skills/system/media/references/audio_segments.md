# audio_segments

Transcribe audio and return segments with timing information for understanding scene transitions.

This tool helps AI agents understand the timing and structure of audio content, which is crucial
for video editing tasks such as:
- Splitting narration into natural scene segments based on speech pauses
- Synchronizing video transitions with audio timing
- Aligning visual content with spoken content
- Creating captions or subtitles with accurate timestamps
- Planning video scene cuts at natural speech boundaries

Args:
    audio_file: Local audio file path or remote URL to transcribe (supports MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
    language: Language code for transcription (default: "en"). Common codes: en, es, fr, de, it, pt, ru, ja, zh, ko
    use_fp16: Use FP16 precision for faster processing (default: True, requires CUDA)

Returns:
    List of segments, each containing:
    - text: The transcribed text for this segment
    - start: Start time of the segment in seconds (float)
    - end: End time of the segment in seconds (float)
    - words: List of word-level timestamps (each with 'word', 'start', 'end')

Example return value:
    [
        {
            "text": "Hello and welcome to this tutorial.",
            "start": 0.5,
            "end": 3.2,
            "words": [
                {"word": "Hello", "start": 0.5, "end": 0.9},
                {"word": "and", "start": 1.0, "end": 1.1},
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "text": "Today we'll be learning about video editing.",
            "start": 3.5,
            "end": 6.8,
            "words": [...]
        }
    ]

Use cases:
    - Find natural pauses between sentences to plan scene transitions
    - Synchronize video clips with specific parts of narration
    - Create dynamic captions that appear word-by-word
    - Split long videos into chapters based on topic changes
    - Identify timing for background music to avoid overlapping with speech

## Usage
```bash
core/bin/tool-cli request '{"server_id": "media", "tool_name": "audio_segments", "arguments": {}}'
```
**Do not use any Python helper code to invoke the `core/bin/tool-cli` command. Run as shell command with arguments directly.**
